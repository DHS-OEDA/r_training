# R Training

This directory houses the files (slides, data, and RMarkdown documents) that are used in the new R training seminar hosted by Oregon DHS research analysts in Oregon Enterprise Data Analytics (http://www.oregon.gov/DHS/BUSINESS-SERVICES/OFRA/Pages/OEDA.aspx). 

No state data is used in this training. All datasets are publicly available and commonly used for teaching statistical concepts and the R statistical computing language.
