# Intro 

This second lab takes an applied project approach to teaching basic data manipulation with `dplyr` and graphing using `ggplot2`. 

This lab was adapted from <http://tutorials.iq.harvard.edu/R/Rgraphics/Rgraphics.html>. It has been changed to conform with the `tidyverse` package and methods of data manipulation.

Datasets are available on the DHS-OEDA GitHub page here: <https://github.com/DHS-OEDA/r_training>

## Objective

The goal of this lab is to re-create this image from The Economist. This will demonstrate how to turn the default graphs produced in R into publication-quality images.

# Getting started

## Data

```{r}
econ_data <- read_csv('data/lab_2/EconomistData.csv')
head(econ_data)
```

The original sources for these data are Transparency International and UN Human Development Reports.


### Exercise

These data consist of Human Development Index and Corruption Perception Index scores for several countries.

1. Create a scatter plot with `CPI` on the x axis and `HDI` on the y axis.
2. Map the color of the the points to `Region`.
3. Map the size of the points to `HDI.Rank`

```{r ex-1}
# Create scatter plot with CPI on x axis and HDI on the y axis.
ggplot(data=econ_data, aes(x=CPI, y=HDI)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = Region, size=HDI.Rank)) 
```

### Exercise

Re-create the graph in the first exercise, but include a smoothing line (`geom_smooth`)


```{r ex-2}
# Create scatter plot with CPI on x axis and HDI on the y axis.
ggplot(data=econ_data, aes(x=CPI, y=HDI)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = Region, size=HDI.Rank)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess") 
```

### Exercise

Using the graph from the previous exercises, let's make some changes to aesthetics. 

1. Rename the axis titles to their full name instead of abbreviations
2. Add a title to the plot
3. Change color scale to something from the `colorbrewR` scales, like `Dark2`. 


```{r ex-3}
ggplot(data=econ_data, aes(x=CPI, y=HDI)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = Region, size=HDI.Rank)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess") +
  ggtitle('Human Development Index vs. Corruption Perception Index') +
  scale_x_continuous(name = "Corruption and Human Development") +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Dark2") +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Human Development Index")

```
