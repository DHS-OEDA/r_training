# Intro 

This second lab takes an applied project approach to teaching basic data manipulation with `dplyr` and graphing using `ggplot2`. 

This lab was adapted from <http://tutorials.iq.harvard.edu/R/Rgraphics/Rgraphics.html>. It has been changed to conform with the `tidyverse` package and methods of data manipulation, and updated from the 2012 copy to reflect package changes.

Datasets are available on the DHS-OEDA GitHub page here: <https://github.com/DHS-OEDA/r_training>

## Objective

The goal of this lab is to re-create this image from The Economist. This will demonstrate how to turn the default graphs produced in R into publication-quality images.

# Getting started

## Data

```{r}
econ_data <- read_csv('data/lab_2/EconomistData.csv')
head(econ_data)
```

The original sources for these data are Transparency International and UN Human Development Reports.


### Exercise

These data consist of Human Development Index and Corruption Perception Index scores for several countries.

1. Create a scatter plot with `CPI` on the x axis and `HDI` on the y axis.
2. Map the color of the the points to `Region`.
3. Map the size of the points to `HDI.Rank`

```{r ex-1}
# Create scatter plot with CPI on x axis and HDI on the y axis.
ggplot(data=econ_data, aes(x=CPI, y=HDI)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = Region, size=HDI.Rank)) 
```

### Exercise

Re-create the graph in the first exercise, but include a smoothing line (`geom_smooth`)


```{r ex-2}
# Create scatter plot with CPI on x axis and HDI on the y axis.
ggplot(data=econ_data, aes(x=CPI, y=HDI)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = Region, size=HDI.Rank)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess") 
```

### Exercise

Using the graph from the previous exercises, let's make some changes to aesthetics. 

1. Rename the axis titles to their full name instead of abbreviations
2. Add a title to the plot
3. Change color scale to something from the `colorbrewR` scales, like `Dark2`. 


```{r ex-3}
ggplot(data=econ_data, aes(x=CPI, y=HDI)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = Region, size=HDI.Rank)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess") +
  ggtitle('Human Development Index vs. Corruption Perception Index') +
  scale_x_continuous(name = "Corruption and Human Development") +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Dark2") +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Human Development Index")

```

### Exercise

Using the graph from the previous exercises, let's make more changes. 

1. Change the geom_point() icons. 
2. Remove the HDI legend. (`guides(size = FALSE)`)
3. Make axis labels and tick marks consistent with original graph. (Hint: Tick marks are "breaks" in ggplot2. Also relevant are "limits"). 
4. Change the theme to `theme_minimal()` from the `ggthemes` package. 

```{r ex-4}
ggplot(data=econ_data, aes(x=CPI, y=HDI)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = Region, size=HDI.Rank),
             shape = 1, fill=NA, stroke=1.5) + # change the symbols to reflect original graph
  geom_smooth(method = "loess") +
  ggtitle('Human Development Index vs. Corruption Perception Index') +
  scale_x_continuous(name = "Corruption and Human Development",
                     breaks = c(1:10), limits = c(1,10)) + # set breaks and limits
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Dark2") +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Human Development Index") +
  guides(size = FALSE) + # remove the legend for size
  theme_minimal() # change theme
```

### Exercise

1. Move the legend to the top
2. Change the legend names for the regions.


```{r ex-5}
ggplot(data=econ_data, aes(x=CPI, y=HDI)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = Region, size=HDI.Rank),
             shape = 1, fill=NA, stroke=1.5) + # change the symbols to reflect original graph
  geom_text(aes(label = Country), check_overlap = T, hjust=-.5, vjust=-.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess") + 
  ggtitle('Human Development Index vs. Corruption Perception Index') +
  scale_x_continuous(name = "Corruption and Human Development",
                     breaks = c(1:10), limits = c(1,10)) + # set breaks and limits
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Dark2", labels = c("Americas", "Asia & Oceania", "Central & Eastern Europe","OECD",
                                  "Middle East & North Africa", "Sub-Saharan Africa")) +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Human Development Index") +
  guides(size = FALSE) + # remove the legend for size
  theme_minimal() + # change theme 
  theme(legend.position = "top")

```

Wow, geom_text really made it messy. Maybe we can clean that up?
